Microbial community in mangrove sediments in south gulf of Mexico

## Introduction

We analyzed the microbial community structure within a mangrove ecosystem using various alpha and beta diversity metrics, including PERMANOVA, PCoA, and Betadisper, to identify the key environmental factors influencing microbial community composition.

We hypothesized that increasing levels of desiccation would lead to a decline in microbial diversity, accompanied by shifts in microbial community structure influenced by both season and depth.
